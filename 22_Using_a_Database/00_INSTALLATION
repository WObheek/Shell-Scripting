1. Install MySQL by running the command `sudo apt-get install mysql-server`.

2. During the installation, you will be prompted to set a root password for the MySQL server. 
   Make sure to choose a strong password.

3. Once the installation is complete, start the MySQL service by running the command 
   >> sudo service mysql start

4. To secure the installation of MySQL, run the command `sudo mysql_secure_installation`. 
   This command will guide you through a series of prompts to set up a secure MySQL environment.

5. To log in to the MySQL shell, run the command `mysql -u root -p` and 
   enter the root password when prompted.

6. Once you are logged in to the MySQL shell, you can start creating databases, tables, and users by running SQL commands.

7. To test your setup, you can try to connect to the MySQL server from another terminal window by running the command 
   >> mysql -u root -p	and enter the root password when prompted.

# ERROR 1
ERROR1: If the socket file is missing, you can try creating a symbolic link to the correct path by running the command 
------ Solution ------
sudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock.


# ERROR 2
SET PASSWORD has no significance for user 'root'@'localhost' as the authentication method used doesn't store authentication data in the MySQL server. 
Please consider using ALTER USER instead if you want to change authentication parameters.
----- Solution ------

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
