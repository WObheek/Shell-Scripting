# connecting to the databases
# You'll need to some how utilize the mysql or psql programs in you shell script.
# FINDING PROGRAM: where the mysql or psql program is in you shell script.

# which command tells you where the shell would find a command if it attempted to run it from the command line.
# which mysql
# which psql

# the easiest way to handle this information is to assign it to an environment variable and then use that in your shell script.
MYSQL=`which mysql`
PSQL=`which psql`
# Now $MYSQL & $PSQL variable points to the executable for their program
