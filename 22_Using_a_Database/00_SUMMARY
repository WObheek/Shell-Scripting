Ability to save, modify,a andn retrieve data from your shell scripts in databases.
You can easily access both the MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers directly from your shell scripts

After installing the MySQL and PostgreSQL servers, you can use their respective client programs to access the servers fro mthe command line, or from shell scripts.
The mysql cliendt program provides the command line interface to the MySQL server,
You can send SQL commands as well as customized MySQL commands to the server from your shell scripts and then retrieve the results.

The psql client program operates the same way  for the PostgreSQL server.
There are plenty of command line parameters you can use to help format your data in just the right way.

Both client programs allow you to send either a single command to the server or use input redirection to send a  batch of commands.
The programs normally send the output data from the server to STDOUT, 
but you can redirect the output to a variable and use that information in you shell script.
