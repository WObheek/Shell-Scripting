# both MySQL and PostgreSQL servers are considered relational databases.
# In relational database, data is organized by data fields, records and table
# data field : single piece of information, records: collection of related data fields (one set of data), tables, 


#### MYSQL
# login as root, and use test database
mysql test -u root -p 

# its extremely important that you make sure you're in the right database before creating the new table,
# also make sure that you're logged in using the administrative user account (root for MySQL and postgres forPostgreSQL) to create the tables.
CREATE TABLE employee (
    empid int not null,
    lastname varchar(30),
    firstname varchar(30),
    salary float,
    primary key (empid));

SHOW tables;	# in mysql

### IN PostgreSQL
sudo -u postgres psql 
\c test		# connects to database :test
# creating tables is same in both mysql & postgresql

\dt		# in psql shows tables
