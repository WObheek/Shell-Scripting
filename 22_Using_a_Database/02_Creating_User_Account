# 'root' : has total control over all of the MySQL server objects 
# (much like: root Linux account has complete control over the linux system).
# it extremely dangerous to use the root mysql account for normal application.


###  CREATE USER ###
# CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password';
CREATE USER  'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password';

# After CREATE USER, you specify a username. 
# This is immediately followed by an @ sign and then the hostname from which this user will connect. 
# If you only plan to access this user locally from your Ubuntu server, you can specify localhost. 
# Wrapping both the username and host in single quotes isn’t always necessary, but doing so can help to prevent errors.
>> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE ON test.* TO 'test'@'localhost';
>> create user ‘test’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’;
 

## TEST the new user account directly from the mysql program:
>> mysql test -u test -p

# This command connects to the MySQL server and attempts to connect to a database named "test" 
# using the username "test" and prompts for a password. 
# The -u flag specifies the username and the -p flag specifies that a password is required to connect.
# Once the user enters the correct password, the mysql client will connect to the specified database and present a command prompt where SQL statements can be executed.
